# The Problem Die.t_HARD solves 

### With the New Year spirits still going on strong , many Indian users amongt the middle aged suburban demographic have decided to better improve their daily eating habits to suit more of a healthy diet plan .

However the main problems arises when they actually get down to make a meal plan . Most of the online resources which aid the formation of a personalized diet plans for its users , are framed to be only useful for foreign markets other than India .

Practically speaking for most of the Indian consumers , these applications provide little to no use  at all as the meals in the daily routine barely contain ingredients which the Indian market is familiar with  . 

Not only that but a lot of these apps have a UI which could only be described as "unknowingly health elitist" for the lack of a better termwhich creates a sort of stereotypical image of who may or may not be its demographic  which psychogically may demotivte the Middle aged user.  Inevitably , user is back to aquare one .

# The Idea 
### Here at die.t_hard , all the meal prep plans are heavily personalized and customizable to make sure the Indian user attains his/her fitness goals by utilizing local Indian food items for its users  . Not only that it also provides basic lessons which would be useful for its users .

The key focus of thought for our website is that we understand the diversity of Indian cuisines and how intimately the cultural identity of each and every state is tied up with its cuisines and food .Thus , we have categorized the Indian dishes into local ,  state wise dishes . The user can choose from a wide variety of dishes of his/her own preferred locality (Maharastrian , Gujarathi , Goan etc) and the algorithm sets up their meal plan amongst the chosen category with caloric and macro nutrient constraints in the form of a graph .
