            <h1>Lesson 1 :The Basics -Food and Calories</h1>

            <h2>What are calories?</h2>
<hr >
<p1>A calorie is a unit of energy , like a what is to power  .

Think of calories as objects in a storage box . Just like how you exchange item "to" and "from" a storage box --calories are a way of keeping track of the energy "in" and "out" of the body's energy budget .

<h2>How are calories calculated ?</h2>
<hr>
<p1>In any given food item the main components are - Carbohydrates , Proteins and fats which are digestible and fibres which is non digestible .

So to calculate calories in any given item all you need to do is Add in the calories of carbs proteins and fats and subtract calorie content of fibres as they are indigestible</p1>

                     <h1>Lesson 3 :Common Activities and their caloric consumption</h1>

                  <h2>So where does this Energy go ?</h2>
      <hr >
      <p1>If you thought the only way you burned calories is through exercise you are in for a surprise !
Energy is used by your body in many ways but primarily for staying alive .
You burn about 70-80% of calories that you consume by just staying alive and processing food everyday(Basal metabolic rate (BMR)) . The rest 20% is what is utilized during conscious voluntary activities .
</p1>

<h2>Fundamental rules of any diet model </h2>
<hr />
<ul>
  MORE CALORIES IN THAN OUT =WEIGHT GAIN(Caloric Surplus)
</ul>
<ul>
CALORIES OUT THAN IN =WEIGHT LOSS(Caloric Deficit)
</ul>
<p1>This set of two rules dictate the formation any diet model . All this macronutrient , calorie energy balance sounds like mumbo jumbo to you ? Don't worry here at Die.t_HARD we do all these calculations for you and provide you with a daily meal plan according to your preferences .

                    <h2>What is Serving Size ?</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <p1>Serving size is the standardized measured amount of food .
It is measured in amount of food -1 cup , 30 g of chips , 1 katori rice etc
For example -Here the number of serving in the bag is 1 and each serving size weighs 74 g . Now each caloric component of the 74 g worth of food tiem is laid out before you</p1>

<p1>A portion size is calculated based on how many calories you plan to consume a day You should then plan your menus by calculating how much of a certain food you can eat to remain within that limit Those are your portion sizes.

Its better to consult a nutritionist first when starting out to ensure that your diet plan meets your daily nutritional goals along with your weight goals .</p1>
